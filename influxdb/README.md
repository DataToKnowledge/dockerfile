# InlufxDB
This docker can be used to start a InlufxDB node.

I've created a convenient script to do this that takes in input one mandatory argument (the name or number of node to create).

## Examples
Cd to the directory where is the dockerfile.

Create a node named `influxdb-#` with

```
$ ./start.sh <id>
```
